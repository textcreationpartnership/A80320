            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the heavenlineſſe of the Matter, the efficacie of the Doctrine, the majeſty of the Stile, the conſent of all the Parts, the Scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God,) the full diſcovery it makes of the onely way of mans ſalvation, the many other incomparable Excellencies, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire perfection thereof, are Arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it ſelf to be the Word of God; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, our full perſwaſion and

                     <p>VI.

                     <p>IX. The infallible Rule of Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture is the Scripture it ſelf: and therefore, when there is a Queſtion

                     <p>BAptiſm is a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, Ordained by Ieſus Chriſt <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 28. 19</note>, not only for the ſolemn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the party Baptized, into the Viſible Church <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 12 13</note>: but alſo, to be unto him a ſigne, and ſeal of the Covenant of Grace <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11 with Col. 2. 11, 12</note>, of his ingrafting into Chriſt <note n="d" place="margin">Gal 3. 27 Rom. 6. 5</note>, of Regeneration <note n="e" place="margin">Tit. 3. 5</note>, of Remiſſion of ſins <note n="f" place="margin">Mark 1. 4</note> and of his giving up unto God through Ieſus Chriſt, to walk in newnes of life <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 6. 3, 4.</note>.

                     <p>II. The outward Element to be uſed in this Sacrament is Water, wherewith the Party is to be Baptized, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, by a Miniſter of the Goſpel, lawfully called thereunto <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 3. 11 Iohn 1. 33 Mat. 28. 19, 20.</note>.</p>
                     <p>III. Dipping of the perſon into the Water, is not neceſſary: but, Baptiſm is rightly adminiſtred, by powring, or ſprinkling Water upon the perſon <note n="k" place="margin">Heb 9. 10, 19, 20, 21, 22 Acts 2. 41 Acts 16. 33 Mark. 7. 4</note>.</p>

                     <p>V. Although it be a great ſin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn or neglect this Ordinance <note n="n" place="margin">Luke 7. 30 with Exo. 4. 24, 25, 26</note>, yet Grace and Salvation are not ſo inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed unto it, as that no perſon can be regenerated or ſaved, without it <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11 Acts 10. 2. 4 23, 31, 45, 47</note>: or, that all that are Baptized, are undoubtedly regenerated <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 8. 13, 23.</note>.</p>
                     <p>VI. The efficacy of Baptiſm is not tied to that moment of time, wherein it is adminiſtred <note n="q" place="margin">Iohn 3. 5, 8</note>: yet, notwithſtanding, by the right uſe of this Ordinance, the grace promiſed, is not only offered, but really exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghoſt, to ſuch (whether of age, or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the Councell of Gods own Will, in his appointed time <note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27 Tit. 3. 5.

                     </p>

                     <p>OVr Lord Ieſus, in the night where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was betrayed, Inſtituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, called the Lords Supper, to be obſerved in his Church, unto the end of the world,

                     <p>II. In this Sacrament Chriſt is not offered up to his Father: nor, any reall Sacrifice made at all, for remiſſion of ſins of the quick or dead <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 9. 22, 25, 26, 28</note>, but only a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of that one offering up of Himſelf, by Himſelf, upon the Croſſe once for all: and a ſpiritual Oblation of all poſſible praiſe unto God, for the ſame <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 11 24, 25, 26 Mat. 26, 26, 27.</note>: So that the Popiſh Sacrifice of the Maſſe (as they call it) is moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably injurious to Chriſts one, onely Sacrifice, the alone Propitiation for all the ſins of the Elect <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 7. 23, 24, 27.

The Lord Ieſus hath, in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, appointed his Miniſters to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his word of inſtitution to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to pray, and bleſſe the Elements of Bread and Wine, &amp; thereby to ſet them apart from a Common to an Holy Vſe: and, to Take, and Break the Bread, to Take the Cup, &amp; (they communicating alſo themſelves) to give both to the

                     <p>IV. Private Maſſes, or receiving this Sacrament by a Prieſt, or any other, alone <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 6</note>, as likewiſe, the denyall of the Cup to the people <note n="h" place="margin">Mark. 4. 23 1 Cor. 11. 25 26, 27, 28, 29</note>, worſhipping the Elements, the lifting them up, or carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he about for adoration, and the reſerving them for any pretended reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious uſe, are all contrary to the nature of this Sacrament, and to the Inſtitution of Chriſt <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 15. 9</note>.</p>
                     <p>V. The outward Elements in this Sacrament, duly ſet apart, to the uſes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Chriſt, have ſuch relation to him crucified, as that truly, yet Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally onely, they are ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of the things they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, to wit, the Body and Blood of Chriſt <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 26 26. 27, 28</note>, albeit, in ſubſtance and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they ſtill remain, truly, and only Bread and Wine, as they were before <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 11 26, 27, 28 Mat. 26. 29</note>.</p>
                     <p>VI. That Doctrine which maintains a change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; Blood (commonly called Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation) by Conſecration of a Prieſt, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common Senſe and Reaſon; overthroweth the nature of the Sacrament, and hath bin, &amp; is, the cauſe of manifold Supertitions, ye, of groſſe Idolatries <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 3. 21 with 1 Cor. 11. 24 25, 26 Luk. 24. 6, 39.</note>.</p>

                     <p> VII. Worthy Receivers outwardly partaking of the viſible Elements, in this Sacrament <note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 11 28.</note>, do then alſo, inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but Spiritually, receive, and feed upon Chriſt crucified, and all benefits of his death: The Body and Blood of Chriſt being then, not corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or carnally, in, with, or under the Bread and Wine; yet, as really, but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, preſent to the Faith of Believers in that Ordinance, as the Elements themſelves are to their outward ſenſes <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor 10 16</note>.</p>
                     <p>VIII. Although ignorant, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men receive the outward Elements, in this Sacrament: yet, they receive not the Thing ſignified thereby; but by their unworthy comming thereunto, are guilty of the Body &amp; Blood of the Lord to their own damnation. Wherefore, all ignorant, and ungodly perſons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with him, ſo are they unworthy of the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and, cannot without great ſin againſt Chriſt, while they remain ſuch, partake of theſe Holy Myſteries <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11 27, 28, 29 2 Cor. 14, 6 15. 16</note>, or be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 6 7, 13 2 Theſſ. 3 6, 14, 15 Mat. 7. 6</note>.</p>

                     <p>This appeareth thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of more Congregations then one, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as is manifeſt, firſt,</p>
                     <p>By the multitude of Beleevers menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in divers,</p>
                     <p>Both before the diſperſion of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers there by means of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (mentioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. in the beginning thereof) witneſs <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. and 2. <hi>v.</hi> 41, 46, 47. and 4. 4. and 5: 14. and Chap. 6. of the ſame book of the <hi>Acts, verſes</hi> 1, 7.</p>
                     <p>And alſo after the diſperſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. Chap. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>4. and Chap. 21. ver. 20. of the ſame book.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By the many Apoſtles and other Preachers in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> And if there were but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation there, then each Apoſtle preached but ſeldom; which will not conſiſt with Chap. 6. verſe 2. of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170670:98"/> ſame book of the Acts of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The diverſity of languages amongſt the Beleevers, mentioned both in the ſecond and ſixth Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> doth argue more Congregations then one in that Church.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, All thoſe Congregations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> were under one Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe; Firſt, They were one Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1. and <hi>Chapter</hi> 2. 47. compared with Chap. 5. 11, and 12. 5. and 15. 4. of the ſame book.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Elders of the Church are mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 30. and 15. 4, 6, 22. and 21. 17, 18. of the ſame book.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtles did the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Acts of Presbyters, as Presbyters in that Kirk, which proveth a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Church before the diſperſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The ſeveral Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being one Church, the Elders of that Church are mentioned as meeting together for acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 30. and 15. 4, 6, 22. and 21. 17, 18. and ſo forward, which proves, that thoſe ſeveral Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were under one Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>And whether theſe Congregations were fixed or not fixed, in regard of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170670:98"/> Officers or Members, it is all one as to the truth of the Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth there appear any material difference betwixt the ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations now in the ordinary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, as to the point of fixedneſs required of Officers or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Therefore the Scripture doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hold forth, that many Congregations may be under one Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By the inſtance of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II:"/> Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1, That they were more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then one in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> appears by <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 31. where is mention of <hi>Pauls</hi> continuance at <hi>Epheſus</hi> in Preaching for the ſpace of three years, and <hi>Acts</hi> 19, 18, 19, 20. where the ſpecial effect of the Word is mentioned, and <hi>verſe</hi> 10, and 17, of the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> where is a diſtinction of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 8, 9. where a reaſon of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtay at <hi>Epheſus</hi> until <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 19, where is mention of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church in the houſe of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> then at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 19, 24, 26. all which laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth prove, that the multitudes of Beleevers did make more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170670:99"/> then one in the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there were many Elders over theſe many Congregations, as one Flock, appeareth, <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 17, 25, 28, 30, 36, 37.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That theſe many Congregations were one Church, and that they were under one Presbyterial Government, appeareth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. the firſt ſix <hi>verſes,</hi> joyned with <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17, 18.</p>
